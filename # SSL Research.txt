# SSL Research

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that secure communication over the internet by encrypting data between client and server. While SSL is now outdated, TLS is the modern standard that provides stronger security and improved performance. HTTPS, which uses SSL/TLS, is more secure than HTTP because it ensures confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication, preventing attackers from intercepting or tampering with data in transit. Without SSL/TLS, web applications are vulnerable to risks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, data leaks, and stolen credentials. Real-world incidents, such as compromised login details on unsecured HTTP sites, have demonstrated how missing or misconfigured SSL can expose sensitive information and damage trust. Therefore, enabling HTTPS by default is essential for protecting users and maintaining application security.
